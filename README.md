This was made for own uses, but decided to share.

The biggest thank you should go to J7mbo (https://github.com/J7mbo) for providing the TwitterAPIExchange.php script. I would of never gotten OAuth right and his script does most of the job.

I don't know if I'm going to add anything to this, it is really simple and made for people as a shortcut to Twitter's REST APIs.

** How to actually use it **
First of all you need a webhost to run this all on. Obviously paid hosts are better, but if you are using this just for testing and/or don't have the money to pay for a webhost, I'd recommend https://heroku.com (follow the getting started with PHP tutorial). It took me a while to get the basic stuff down, but it's been working great since then. A bit difficult to manipulate many apps with the cmd bar though. Any webhost with PHP support should work though.

Second, you need to create a Twitter Application on https://apps.twitter.com/.
